           audio output to the WiFi display encoder in the media server.

    <!-- Array of light sensor LUX values to define our levels for auto backlight brightness support.

         The control points must be strictly increasing.  Each control point
         corresponds to an entry in the brightness backlight values arrays.
         For example, if LUX == level[1] (first element of the levels array)
         then the brightness will be determined by value[2] (second element
         of the brightness values array).

         Spline interpolation is used to determine the auto-brightness
         backlight values for LUX levels between these control points.
